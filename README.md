## !! As of `Oct. 8, 2023` I have discovered the NHL has created a new API !!
- I am unsure what this means for this project as it stands.
- I am hoping the NHL continues to support their prior API, for which this project has been designed around.
- If not, I will plan to rework this project once I have more information and the 2023/2024 season gets underway.
